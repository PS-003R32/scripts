## password_manager
To generate an executable `.exe` instead of using the python file directly, this will create an executable file which you can find in the `dist` folder. You can rename to whatever you want as this is completely `offline password manager` that you can store in a pendrive or flash storages etc. Run the following command:<br>
```python
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile password_manager.py
```
